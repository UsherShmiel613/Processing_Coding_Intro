<p>The internet is one of the great modern day miracles. It connects billions of people across the globe, sharing endless streams of information with a few clicks.</p>
<p><em>Watch this video to get an idea of just how much goes on to bring you even a simple web page.</em></p>

</ul>
<p>What we usually call the <strong>Internet</strong> is a collection of many thousands of <strong>networks</strong>, all connected through a global <strong>internet</strong>, which gives us access to all publicly available websites, known as the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Computer Network</strong> connects local computers so they can share resources and communicate, like sharing a printer in an office.</li>
<li><strong>An Internet</strong> connects networks in different locations so they can send each other messages and files. “The Internet” is a giant global network connecting billions of devices.</li>
<li><strong>The World Wide Web</strong> is a system that uses the global Internet to make certain information (mostly cat videos 😻) accessible to anyone in the world who requests them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h4>
<p><strong>Servers</strong> Think of a <strong>server</strong> like a waiter at a restaurant, who takes your order and brings you back a plate of food. <strong>Servers</strong> are special computers that wait for for you to requests some files, and then sends you the files you ask for. For example, when you type request “<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>” a server sends your computer the files it needs to display Google’s website.</p>
<p>Your <strong>web browser</strong> is a special program that helps you make these requests, and then read the files sent by the server, rendering them as a website on your machine.</p>
<h3 id="the-language-of-the-web">The Language of The Web</h3>
<p>Today websites are built out of three coding languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> defines the basic structure and content of a site.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong> gives a site its style, such as layout, color, and font.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> makes sites interactive.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="some-history">Some History</h4>
<p>The first computer networks where used for military communication. Then, universities started using internet connections to share academic research. They needed a way to format their research papers to display things like headings and lists. A special file format was created for this called the Hypertext Markup Language, or <strong>HTML</strong> for short.</p>
<p>Soon, with the growth of the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, people and business started using the internet for more than simple text documents. They wanted a way to style websites into something more visually appealing. For this a new language was created, called Cascading Style Sheets, or <strong>CSS</strong> for short.</p>
<p>Then, as computers and networks become faster and more powerful, the possibility of making websites interactive gave rise to scripting languages, and so <strong>JavaScript</strong> was born and became the standard for all browsers.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>When you visit any website, your browser uses a global network—the Internet—to request that site’s files from a server. The server (typically) sends you three files:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <strong>HTML</strong> file. This file contains the website’s content, but it will basically look like a school report made in Word.</li>
<li>A <strong>CSS</strong> file. This file tells the browser how to style the site. Think of this like having a graphic designer make a nice poster or flyer. It is beautiful, but not interactive.</li>
<li>A <strong>JavaScript</strong> file. This file allows the website to be interactive, like an app, an online store, or a game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your browser reads these documents, and uses them to build a copy of the website on your screen.</p>
<p>In the rest of this course, we will learn how to use these three languages to build websites and interactive web apps.</p>
